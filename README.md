## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"[Field Name] cannot be empty"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Looks like this is not an email"_

## My process

### Built with

- TypeScript
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) - Form library

### What I learned

The major take away from this project is a fundamental understanding of how to use React Hook Form and how to include type validation in HTML forms using TypeScript.

Another thing that I learned was how to incorporate .svg art into my project, as well as insert these assets into input fields using CSS pseudo selectors, like ::after and ::before.

### Continued development

I hope to continue to further develope my skills with React and TypeScript, as well as learn more CSS tricks and techniques.
